In a world where dreams take flight,  
Beneath the canvas of the night,  
Stars above like diamonds gleam,  
In a cosmic, timeless stream.  

Moonlight bathes the silent earth,  
In its gentle, silver birth,  
Whispers of a secret lore,  
Hidden in its ancient core.  

Rivers winding, forests deep,  
Promises that nature keeps,  
Life in every blade of grass,  
A fleeting moment, but it'll pass.  

Love's sweet kiss and tears of sorrow,  
Both are part of life's grand tomorrow,  
Embracing joy and facing strife,  
We navigate the river of life.  

In the tapestry of human souls,  
Each one playing unique roles,  
Striving for a higher goal,  
Bound together, heart and soul.  

Through the seasons, we shall dance,  
In life's delicate, intricate trance,  
With each step, we find our way,  
In this wondrous, fleeting day.
